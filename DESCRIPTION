Description: This multivariate zero-inflated logistic model is used to analyze microbiome
    relative abundance (RA) data. The model takes into account three specific features of 
    microbiome relative abundance data: compositionality, sparsity and high dimensionality.
    The model estimates relationship between covariates and individual taxa RAs using regression
    techniques. Details can be found at [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12561-018-9219-2).
