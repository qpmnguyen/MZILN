# MZILN
## A multivariate zero-inflated logistic model for microbiome relative abundance data  

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/quangnguyen1995/MZILN.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/quangnguyen1995/MZILN)

This is a work in progress package for the statistical model presented in the paper "Conditional regression based on a multivariate zero-inflated logistic normal model for microbiome relative abundance data". [Statistics in Biosciences](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12561-018-9219-2).  

### Features being worked on:
* Vectorizing previous functions to improve performance.  
* A stable release with current functions.    
* Vignettes.  

### Stretch goals
* Upload on CRAN  
* Rewrite bottleneck matrix transformations using RCpp.
