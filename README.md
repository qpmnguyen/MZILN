## A multivariate zero-inflated logistic model for microbiome relative abundance data

This is a work in progress package for the statistical model presented in the paper "Conditional regression based on a multivariate zero-inflated logistic normal model for microbiome relative abundance data" ([in pre-print](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07798v2)).  

### Features being worked on:
* Fixing utility functions necessary for package deployment.  
* Reproducible testing units.  
* Testing with different types of data sets.  
* Testing with real data sets.  
* Finish with documentation.  

### Stretch goals
* CRAN support  
* RCppEigen for improved performance.
